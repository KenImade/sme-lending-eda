# Exploratory Data Analysis of 504 Loans Data

## Project Overview

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 504 Loan data provided by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The 504 Loan program offers long-term, fixed-rate financing to small businesses in the United States for major fixed assets such as real estate and equipment. Our analysis seeks to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that could help stakeholders understand the landscape of small business financing.
